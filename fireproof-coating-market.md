<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fireproof Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Based Coating</li><li>Water Based Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fireproof coatings can be divided into two main types: solvent-based coatings and water-based coatings. Solvent-based coatings are made with chemicals that evaporate and create a hard protective layer when dry. They are known for their durability and resistance to high temperatures. On the other hand, water-based coatings are made with water as a carrier for the protective chemicals. They are preferred for their environmentally friendly properties and ease of application. Both types of coatings are used to provide fire resistance to surfaces and materials.</p></p>
