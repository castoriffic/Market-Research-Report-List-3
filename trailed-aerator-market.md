<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Trailed Aerator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Axis</li><li>Horizontal Axis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Trailed aerators are commonly classified into two types based on their axis of rotation: vertical axis and horizontal axis. Vertical axis trailed aerators have tines that rotate in a vertical direction, making them suitable for aerating smaller, more compact areas. On the other hand, horizontal axis trailed aerators have tines that rotate in a horizontal direction, making them ideal for larger, open spaces. Both types of trailed aerators are used in agricultural, landscaping, and gardening applications to improve soil aeration and promote healthy plant growth.</p></p>
