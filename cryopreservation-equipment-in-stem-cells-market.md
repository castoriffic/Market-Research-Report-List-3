<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cryopreservation Equipment in Stem Cells Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Phase</li><li>Vapor Phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cryopreservation equipment in the stem cells market includes two types: liquid phase and vapor phase. Liquid phase cryopreservation involves the storage of stem cells in liquid nitrogen at temperatures below -150Â°C. This method ensures efficient cell preservation with minimal damage. On the other hand, vapor phase cryopreservation utilizes liquid nitrogen only in vapor form to maintain a slightly higher temperature, preventing direct contact with the cells. This technique helps minimize contamination risks and can be more cost-effective for long-term storage.</p></p>
