<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calcium Carbonate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground Calcium Carbonate (GCC)</li><li>Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ground Calcium Carbonate (GCC) is produced by grinding natural limestone or marble into a fine powder. It is commonly used in various applications such as construction, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals. On the other hand, Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC) is produced through a chemical process involving calcium hydroxide and carbon dioxide. PCC has a higher purity and smaller particle size compared to GCC, making it suitable for applications such as paper, plastics, and paints. Both GCC and PCC cater to different market demands and have their distinct characteristics.</p></p>
