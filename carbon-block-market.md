<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Block Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extruded Type</li><li>Compressed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon block filters are commonly divided into two main types - extruded and compressed. Extruded carbon blocks are made by pushing a mixture of carbon powder and a binding agent through a die to create a solid block with uniform pores. Compressed carbon blocks, on the other hand, are made by compressing powdered carbon into a block form. Both types of carbon blocks are used in water filtration systems to effectively remove impurities and improve the taste and odor of water.</p></p>
