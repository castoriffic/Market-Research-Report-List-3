<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant Polyester Fibre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phosphorous Flame Retardant</li><li>Halogen Flame Retardant</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flame retardant polyester fiber is divided into three main types based on the chemicals used for flame retardancy: phosphorous flame retardant, halogen flame retardant, and other markets. Phosphorous flame retardants work by releasing phosphorus compounds that disrupt the combustion process. Halogen flame retardants release halogen gases when exposed to heat, which inhibit the spread of fire. Other markets include alternative flame retardant chemicals such as nitrogen-based compounds or mineral fillers that provide flame resistance without the use of phosphorous or halogen chemicals.</p></p>
